# #7 - Initialize Function for relationships

In Phalcon's model classes, the `initialize()` method is a special method used for setting up model-specific configurations, such as defining relationships and metadata. When you define the `initialize()` method in a model class, you are effectively overriding the default implementation provided by the parent class, `\Phalcon\Mvc\Model`.

Unlike some other frameworks or programming languages where you explicitly call the parent method when overriding a method, Phalcon does not require or support calling the parent `initialize()` method within your model class. This is because Phalcon's ORM operates differently from traditional object-oriented frameworks.

Phalcon's ORM uses reflection to analyze the structure of model classes and automatically applies the configurations specified in the `initialize()` method when the model is instantiated. This means that the `initialize()` method in the parent class is not meant to be called directly, as it's automatically invoked by Phalcon's ORM behind the scenes.

By allowing you to define model-specific configurations directly within the `initialize()` method of your model classes, Phalcon simplifies the process of setting up relationships, metadata, and other configurations. This approach promotes cleaner, more concise code and improves the overall developer experience.

So, while it's not necessary to call the parent `initialize()` method in Phalcon model classes, you can still override the `initialize()` method and define custom behavior if needed. However, it's essential to be aware of the intended purpose of the `initialize()` method and ensure that your customizations complement Phalcon's ORM functionalities.

For example, here is how to use it to register relationships.

```php
class User extends \Phalcon\Mvc\Model
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        $this->hasManyToMany(
            'id',
            'UserRole',
            'user_id',
            'role_id',
            'Role',
            'id',
            ['alias' => 'Roles']
        );
    }
}

class Role extends \Phalcon\Mvc\Model
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        $this->hasManyToMany(
            'id',
            'UserRole',
            'role_id',
            'user_id',
            'User',
            'id',
            ['alias' => 'Users']
        );
    }
}

class UserRole extends \Phalcon\Mvc\Model
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        $this->belongsTo('user_id', 'User', 'id');
        $this->belongsTo('role_id', 'Role', 'id');
    }
}
```

then use it like below.

```php
// Find user and their roles
$user = User::findFirst(1);
foreach ($user->roles as $role) {
    echo $role->name;
}

// Find role and its users
$role = Role::findFirst(1);
foreach ($role->users as $user) {
    echo $user->username;
}
```
